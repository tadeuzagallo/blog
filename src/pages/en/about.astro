  # About me

  Hi, I'm Tadeu!

  I'm a Software Engineer originally form Brazil, currently living in Stockholm and working as a Principal Engineer at Klarna.

  I've been programming for about 12 years now, and have worked with several technologies during this time. I have worked at Apple on the JavaScript Virtual Machine (JSC), at Uber on the Developer Experience team and at Facebook on the React Native core team and was one of the first members of the React Native performance team.

  In general, I'm interested in programming languages and developer experience and on my spare time I'm trying to learn how to [build and race cars](https://www.instagram.com/tzagallo_racing) :)
