  # About me

  I'm a Software Engineer currently working on React Native at Facebook.

  I've been programming for about 5 years now, and have worked with several technologies during this time. Now working mostly with Objective-C and C, focusing on React Native's performance.

  On my own time I like to learn about compilers and low level programming, and every once in a while I take a stab at writing a compiler for my own language.  So far it hasn't resulted in anything I'm proud of, but I still believe it's a great way to learn :)
