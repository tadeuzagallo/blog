        <div class="blog-post-text astro-ZRE6QY23">
          <p>About 10 years ago, I set a goal for myself: I wanted to work for a Big Techâ„¢ company. That meant I had to learn English. My strategy was to switch everything I could in my day-to-day life to English: my phone and computer, watching TV in English, all my note taking, and whatever else I could think of.</p>
<p>Looking back, Iâ€™d say it worked well for me. I left Brazil in 2015 to work for Facebook in London, and in 2016 I gave my first talk in English (at React.JS Conf) in front of hundreds of people, back at a time when conferences still happened in person. Since then I also lived in the Netherlands, US and now Sweden. I also worked for Uber, Apple and now Klarna.</p>
<p>I have never been a very public person, but throughout this time I gave about a dozen talks and wrote about the same number of blog posts, so slowly I accumulated a small-ish audience. On top of the content I produced related to my day job, I also kept all my personal blogging, social medias and everything else in English. After all, it was good for practicing, and a good chunk of my followers didnâ€™t speak Portuguese, <strong>and it increased the number of people I could potentially reach.</strong></p>
<p>However, a few things happened over the last couple of years that really changed my perspective:</p>
<ol>
<li>For one, the pandemic hit me pretty hard and, just like many folks I know, got me feeling really disconnected from my family, friends, peers and all the communities I used to be a part of.</li>
<li>A Brazilian company reached out to me, and even though things didnâ€™t work out, I was more excited about the idea of reconnecting with the Brazilian tech community than I had been about anything else in quite a while.</li>
<li>This in turn led me to reflect about how disconnected I had been from the Brazilian tech community, since long before the pandemic. The last event I participated in Brazil was a conference back in 2016.</li>
</ol>
<p>I reflected on that for a few months, and I knew that I <strong>really</strong> wanted contribute back to the tech community that was crucial to my career, but I wasnâ€™t quite sure how I could contribute or what I had to offer. On top of that, if I switched back to writing in Portuguese Iâ€™d have a smaller <strong>potential</strong> audience and I didnâ€™t really want to annoy the few followers I had slowly accumulated over the years, some of which were people who I really admired and who didnâ€™t speak Portuguese.</p>
<p>In the end, I realized I didnâ€™t really careâ€¦ <strong>Yes, thereâ€™s a larger audience in English, but thereâ€™s also a lot more content. So maybe, just maybe, the best way to make a difference isnâ€™t reaching the most people?</strong> All that was left was to figure out how to contribute.</p>
<p>Some time later, while having a chat with a fellow Brazillian expat, <a href="https://twitter.com/dballona/">Diego Ballona</a>, we realized we felt much the same way, and we decided to partner and launch a new project: <a href="https://comunida.dev/">Comunida.dev</a>. It is an online community where weâ€™re offering mentorship to fellow Brazilians in tech, and weâ€™ll also be sharing relevant content in the form of live interviews on YouTube. Longer term, the goal is to build a real community around it, truly open for anyone to contribute, and weâ€™ll just try and help however we can to get it there.</p>
<p>Soâ€¦ if youâ€™ve been following me because you liked some of my English content, Iâ€™m sorry about the recent inrush of Portuguese content, but Iâ€™m afraid there will be more. However, if you decide to stick around, thereâ€™ll still be English content. I hope to get back to it as soon as Iâ€™ve fully adjusted to the new job.</p>
<p>Thank you ðŸ™‚</p>
